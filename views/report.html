            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This report outlines the design and implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application as part of the "DevOps Fundamentals for Canadian Enterprise" class. The pipeline employs GitHub for version control, Jenkins on AWS for automation, Docker Hub for image storage, and utilizes SSH to run the application on another EC2 instance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Pipeline Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The CI/CD pipeline aims to streamline the process of developing, testing, and deploying a Node.js application through the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Code pushed to the GitHub repository.</li>
                <li>Jenkins instance hosted on an EC2 instance will run a job when code changes posted to GitHub are detected.</li>
                <li>Jenkins clones the code, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to Docker Hub.</li>
                <li>Jenkins connects via SSH to another EC2 instance to execute an SSH file, which will be responsible for downloading the image and creating a container.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <!-- Additional sections can be added as needed -->

        <!-- Example section for displaying code -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
            <h3>GitHub Repository</h3>
            <p>
                GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
                The Node.js application source code is hosted in a GitHub private repository. Developers commit changes to this repository, initiating the CI/CD pipeline.
            </p>
            <h3>AWS Environment</h3>
            <p>
                Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud, offering many data center services across the globe. One such service is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), which provides on-demand, scalable computing power in the cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs and reduces application development and deployment times.
                An AWS instance hosts Jenkins for automation and continuous integration; Jenkins is configured to monitor the GitHub repository for changes via webhooks. Upon detecting changes, Jenkins runs a pipeline hosted in the repository. In this instance, Docker will be installed to create the container image.
                Another EC2 instance will be created to run the Node.js application, this EC2 instance can only be accessed via SSH from the EC2 instance with Jenkins, and it will have Docker installed to download the container image and start the application container.
            </p>
            <h3>Docker</h3>
            <p>
                Docker software allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that include everything needed for the software to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. With Docker, you can rapidly deploy and scale applications in any environment with the confidence that your code will run.
            </p>
            <h3>Dockerfile</h3>
            <p>
                Docker can build images automatically by reading instructions in a dockerfile. Below is the docker file with the necessary instructions to create the image of our application.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                FROM node:16

                # Create app directory
                WORKDIR /usr/src/app

                COPY package*.json ./

                RUN npm install

                COPY . .

                EXPOSE 3000
                CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
            </div>
            
            <h3>Docker Hub</h3>
            <p>
                Docker Hub is a collaboration tool and a marketplace for community developers, open-source contributors, and independent software vendors (ISVs) to distribute their code publicly. Docker Hub provides a consistent, secure, and trusted experience, making it easy for developers to access necessary software.
                The container image will be stored in Docker Hub and then downloaded to the EC2 instance that hosts the application. For Jenkins to push the container image to Docker Hub, a token must be created on Docker Hub and stored as a credential in Jenkins.
            </p>
            <h3>Jenkins</h3>
            <p>
                Jenkins is an open-source server that automates software development's build, test, and deployment parts, making integration easier and reducing continuous delivery times. When code published on GitHub changes, an alert is sent to Jenkins to run a job to clone the master branch using pre-configured credentials since the repository is private. The Jenkins file stored at the project's root contains the CI/CD pipeline instructions.
            </p>

                                    echo 'Buils container image..'
                                    sh 'docker build -t henamorado/hello-world-node:latest .'
                                }
                            }

                                echo 'push image to docker hub..'
                                sh 'docker push henamorado/hello-world-node:latest'
                            }
                        }

                            steps {
                                echo 'execute sh file on app-server..'
                                sshagent(['app_server_ssh_key']) {
                                    sh 'ssh -tt -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ec2-user@10.0.6.81 sudo sh docker_run.sh'
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    post {
                        always {
                            sh 'docker logout'
                        }
                    }
                }                
            </div>
            <p>
                The pipeline consists of three stages.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Build the container image with the latest code update on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Authenticate to the docker hub with the credentials previously configured in Jenkins and push the container image.</li>
                <li>Connect via ssh to the deployment server and run a sh file with instructions to deploy the new container image.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A final step will always be executed in case some step fails, and it is to log out of Docker hub.</p>
